    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        I am Vipin Kumar Patel. I am a 2nd-year student at National Institute of Technology, Agartala. My Major is Electrical Engineering.I have some soft copies of ALLEN Kota study material which I had been given during my preparation. These materials are old but you can get help from them. I found ALLEN study material best of all during my preparation. That is why I am sharing all the study materials which I have. Hope you will find them helpful.
